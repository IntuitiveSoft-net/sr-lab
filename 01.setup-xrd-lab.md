# 01. Setup XRD Lab

## Create a container based XR lab

```bash
cd $HOME/lab/sr-lab
```

Generate a docker-compose file from the docker-compose.xr.yaml sample
```bash
xr-compose -i 541301263746.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cloud-native-router -f docker-compose.xr.yml
```

Instantiate the lab
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

A handy linux bash script let you connect towards the different router instances.

Usage is the following :
```
xrd <router id>
```

Wait 5 min for the router to come up then connect to a router instance
```bash
xrd 1
```

:pushpin:
- When first connecting to an XRd instance warning messages may appear regarding insufficient permissions or `/pkg/bin/ssh_launch.sh:` script with too many arguments. You can disregard those errors.

During the labs you will be instructed to run commands towards the different equipment.

If you need to execute the command on a router, the command will be decorated by the instruction :keyboard: xrd-X 

It's a friendly reminder on the instance you need to run the command on. It will come useful in the case you have several terminals open.

:keyboard: xrd-1

```bash
show running-config 
```

:keyboard: xrd-1

```bash
show run router isis
```
