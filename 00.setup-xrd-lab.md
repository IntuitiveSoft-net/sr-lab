# Setup XRD Lab

## Create a container based XR lab

```bash
cd $HOME/lab/example/bgp-ospf-triangle
```

Generate a docker-compose file from the docker-compose.xr.yaml sample
```bash
xr-compose -i 541301263746.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cloud-native-router -f docker-compose.xr.yml
```

Instantiate the lab
```bash
docker-compose up -d

Wait 5 min for the router to come up then connect to a router instance
