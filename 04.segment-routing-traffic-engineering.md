# Segment routing traffic engineering

Segment routing enables you to steer the traffic in any arbitrary manner within the network, just inserting the appropriate set of Node or Adj SID in the packet to express any deterministic paths.
Traffic over SR engineered paths, or SR Policies (see draft-filsfils-spring-segment-routing-policy), can be steered either dynamically or explicitly. Since, we are showing, how we can use Segment Routing Traffic Engineering to steer the traffic, we will be using the explicit path.

Enable SR-MPLS traffic engineering on all the routers

```bash
configure
 router ospf 1
  mpls traffic-eng router-id loopback 0
  area 0
   mpls traffic-eng
commit
```

```bash
show segment-routing traffic-eng ipv4 topology summary
```

```bash
configure
 router ospf 1
 distribute link state
