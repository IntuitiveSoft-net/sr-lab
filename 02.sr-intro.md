# 02. Segment Routing Introduction

Segment Routing simplifies MPLS. It provides source-based routing, allowing the source to choose a path, which is then added to the packet header as an ordered list of segments. The rest of the network executes the encoded instructions. All of which is done without keeping any state within the network, because labels are no longer assigned on a per LSP basis, but instead on a per segment basis. Also, label distribution protocols are no longer required as Segment Routing control plane leverages link state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) IS-IS and OSPF, and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for the distribution.

In summary Segment Routing can be characterized by:

- A segment is a topological or service instruction.
- A Segment List is an ordered list of instructions.
- Source routing: the source encodes a list of segments in the header of a packet to steer the packet along the desired multi-area, multi-domain topological and service path.
- The nodes in a network process a packet based on the instructions in its header.
- Per-flow state is only maintained at the source, not in the network.
- Prefic Segment: steers a packet along ECMP-aware shortest path to the segment's prefix Global segment.
- Node Segment: Prefix Segment of a prefix that represents a node (i.e. router-id)
- Anycast Segment: steers a packet along ECMP-aware shortest path to the segment's anycast prefix
- Adjacency Segment: steers a packet on the link of the segment's adjacency. Typically a local segment.
- BGP Peer Segment: steers a packet towards a specific BGP peer (over a specific link) overruling BGP decision process. Typically a local segment.
- Segment Routing can be implemented on different data planes (MPLS and IPv6) adn control plane protocols (ISIS, OSPF, BGP).

The tasks related to Segment Routing lab introduction include:

- understand the ISIS lab topology (task 1. to 4.)
- configure Segment Routing leveraging ISIS control plane (task 5. to 9.)
- understand SR IGP ECMP-aware capability (tasks 10. and 11.)

The topology of the lab is highlighted below:

![Lab Topology](images/02.sr-intro-1.svg)

Segments are instructions that nodes execute on the incoming packets, which carries the instructions in its header. Instructions include commands like `forward packet to the shortest path`, `forward packet through a specific interface`, `deliver packet to a specific application/service instance`, etc.

Each segment is identified by the Segment ID (SID). The format of the SID depends on the implementation. Example of SID formats are: an MPLS label, an index value in an MPLS label space, an IPv6 address.
In addition, as we previously mentioned, state is removed from the network. This is because labels are no longer assigned on a per LSP basis, but instead on a per segment basis.

## Get familiar with lab topology

### Task 1. Check the IS-IS interfaces

Visualise the router interfaces announced in IS-IS process `core`:

```bash
xrd 1
```

:keyboard: xrd-1

```bash
show isis interface brief
```

You should have an output similar to:

```console
IS-IS core Interfaces
    Interface      All     Adjs    Adj Topos  Adv Topos  CLNS   MTU    Prio  
                   OK    L1   L2    Run/Cfg    Run/Cfg                L1   L2

Gi0/0/0/2          Yes    -    0      1/1        1/1     Up    1497    -    - 
```

### Task 2. Check the IS-IS neighbors

You can verify the number of neighbors known via IS-IS with the following command:

:keyboard: xrd-1

```bash
show isis neighbors
```

You should have an output similar to:

```console
IS-IS core neighbors:
System Id      Interface        SNPA           State Holdtime Type IETF-NSF
xrd-3          Gi0/0/0/0        *PtoP*         Up    23       L2   Capable 
xrd-5          Gi0/0/0/1        *PtoP*         Up    29       L2   Capable 
```

### Task 3. Check the IS-IS topology

Verify the IS-IS topology. Take a time to verify that you know every other nodes with the expected metric.

:keyboard: xrd-1

```bash
show isis topology
```

You should have an output similar to:

```console

```

:question: Questions:

- Why is xrd-2 node appearing twice ?

### Task 4. Verify routing table

You should be learning the Loopbacks and inter-links from the other nodes of the topology.

:keyboard: xrd-1

```bash
show ip route

## Configure Segment Routing

Although static configuration of segment instruction on the nodes in the network would be possible in theory, a routing protocol is generally used to distribute the segment information in the network. The SR control plane is currently specified for the link state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) IS-IS and OSPF, and for the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

In the current lab we will leverage IS-IS control plane to distribute segment information.

A pool of global labels are defined (the SRGB aka SR Global Block), each label is then assigned to each node. The IGP (IS-IS/OSPF) then signals each of these assigned labels within the SR domain, so that each node has the shortest path within its MPLS table to the given prefix.

For example, we will configure node xrd-1 with the SRGB label of 16001. If node xrd-2 pushes the label 16001 to the top of its label stack, the packet will be switched via the shortest path (via node xrd-3 and xrd-4 or via xrd-5 and xrd-6).

### Task 5. Activate segment-routing on xrd-1

:keyboard: xrd-1

```bash
configure terminal
router isis core
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  segment-routing mpls
 interface Loopback0
  address-family ipv4 unicast
   prefix-sid absolute 16001
   commit
   end
exit
```

### Task 6. Activate segment-routing on all the routers

Adapt the configuration template and configure accordingly the other lab devices xrd-2 to xrd-7.

### Task 7. Check SR Prefix and Adjacency SIDs

SR on the MPLS data plane leverages the existing MPLS architecture (IETF RFC 3031). A Segment Identifier (SID) is represented as a MPLS label or an index value in a MPLS label space. The SID List is represented in the packet header as a stack of MPLS labels. The SR MPLS data plane implementation can be used with both IPv4 and IPv6 address families. Both IPv4 and IPv6 control planes can program the MPLS forwarding entries.

Verify the allocated and announced SR Prefix and Adjacency sids.

```bash
xrd 1
```

:keyboard: xrd-1

```bash
show mpls forwarding
```

You should have an output similar to:

```console

24003  Pop         SR Adj (idx 3)     Gi0/0/0/1    100.1.5.5       0 
```

:question: Question:

- What does `Pop` means ?

Beside executing the instruction encoded in the SID List, the nodes also manage the Segment List itself. The instruction that is currently being executed on the packet is the instruction of the `Active Segment`. Three basic operations are defined on the SID List:
|Operation|Behaviour|
|-|-|
|PUSH|insert segment(s) at the head of the SID List and set the first segment as the Active Segment. If the packet did not have a SID List in its header it is inserted first|
|CONTINUE|the Active Segment is not completed and therefore remains Active|
|NEXT|the Active Segment is completed; the next segment in the SID List becomes the Active Segment|
|||

These SID List operations are mapped to the actual data plane operations done on the packet header.

Unlike the IGP prefix segments, the IGP adjacency segments are dynamically generated/assigned. When a node discovers a neighbor, the node will automatically assign a label for the adjacent link. The label format is 1XY – X is the "from" – Y is the "to", as shown below.

Visualize the adjacency SID allocated to xrd-1 interfaces :

:keyboard: xrd-1

```bash
show mpls label table detail 
```

```console

```

:information_source: On Cisco IOS-XR implementation ISIS pre-allocates an Adj-SID for protection mechanism (FRR,TI-LFA).

### Task 9. Test the Segment Routing MPLS data plane

## Verify Equal Cost Multi-Path

Segment Routing support and leverage ECMP natively. From previous activity you verified that two equal cost multi-path (ECMP) are available to get to xrd-2.
The picture below highlight the 2x equal cost multi paths between xrd-1 and xrd-2.

![ECMP capability](images/02.sr-intro-2.svg)

### Task 10. Trace multi-paths with MPLS OAM toolkit

You can seek for multi-paths with the following command :

:keyboard: xrd-1

```bash
traceroute sr-mpls multipath 2.2.2.2/32 verbose
```

You should have an output similar to:

```console

  'L' - labeled output interface, 'B' - unlabeled output interface, 
  'D' - DS Map mismatch, 'F' - no FEC mapping, 'f' - FEC mismatch,
