# 05. Path Computation Element

In the following lab we will introduce a new concept and utilisation of a dynamic centralized control of a SR-TE network with the usage of a Path Computation Element (PCE). A Path Computation Element is an entity (component, application, or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
route based on a network graph and applying computational constraints.

For now the computation, and instantiation of the policy were done directly on the Path Computation Client (PCC) element. A Path Computation Client is any client application requesting a
path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element (PCE).

The communication between a PCE and a PCC is enabled via a Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) session.

By design, the PCE doesn't have to be part of the same AS of its different PCC. 
Border Gateway Protocol Link-State (BGP-LS) is an Address Family Identifier (AFI) and Sub-address Family Identifier (SAFI) defined to carry interior gateway protocol (IGP) link-state database through BGP routing protocol.
It's a common recommended design to maintain a BGP-LS session between the PCE and the autonomous system boundary router (ASBR) to exange different AS IGP topologies.

### Task 1. Configure the PCE

Connect to xrd-7
```bash
xrd 7
```

:keyboard: xrd-7
```bash
configure
pce
 address ipv4 7.7.7.7
!
commit 
end
```

## BGP-Link State

BGP-LS (Border Gateway Protocol - Link State) is a extension to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) that allows BGP to carry link-state information. In the context of Segment Routing, BGP-LS can be used as a control plane to distribute routing information and construct a network topology map. This information can then be used by Segment Routing to calculate the optimal path for a packet through the network.

BGP-LS allows Segment Routing to leverage the scalability and stability of BGP, while also providing the ability to encode detailed path information in the packet header. This allows for more fine-grained control over the path that packets take through the network, enabling a wide range of advanced routing features and traffic engineering capabilities.


### Task 2. Configure BGP-LS PCE

```bash
configure
!
router bgp 65000

exit
```

end
exit
```

Connect to xrd-1
```bash
xrd 1
```

:keyboard: xrd-1

### Task 6. Configure PCC with PCE 

Connect to xrd-1
```bash
xrd 1
```

:keyboard: xrd-1
```bash
config

  pcc
   source-address ipv4 1.1.1.1
   pce address ipv4 7.7.7.7
   !

end
```

:pushpin: 
* The `report-all` keyword enable the `stateful` capability. The PCC will report all policy created to the PCE.
* Several PCE can be declared, in that case a `precedence` must be defined to select the preferred PCE.
