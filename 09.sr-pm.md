# 09. SR Performance Measurement 

## Performance Measurement (PM)

Network performance metrics is a critical measure for traffic engineering (TE) in service provider networks. Network performance metrics include the following:

* Packet loss
* Delay
* Delay variation

These network performance metrics provide network operators information about the performance characteristics of their networks for performance evaluation and help to ensure compliance with service level agreements. The service-level agreements (SLAs) of service providers depend on the ability to measure and monitor these network performance metrics. Network operators can use performance measurement (PM) feature to monitor the network metrics for links and end-to-end TE label switched paths.

The PM for link delay uses the IP/UDP packet format defined in RFC 5357 (TWAMP-Light) for probes. Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) adds two-way or round-trip measurement capabilities. TWAMP employs time stamps applied at the echo destination (reflector) to enable greater accuracy. In the case of TWAMP Light, the Session-Reflector doesn’t necessarily know about the session state. The Session-Reflector simply copies the Sequence Number of the received packet to the Sequence Number field of the reflected packet. The controller receives the reflected test packets and collects two-way metrics. This architecture allows for collection of two-way metrics.

The following restrictions and guidelines apply for the PM for link delay feature for different links.

* For broadcast links, only point-to-point (P2P) links are supported. P2P configuration on IGP is required for flooding the value.

* For link bundles, the hashing function may select a member link for forwarding but the reply may come from the remote line card on a different member link of the bundle.

* For one-way delay measurement, clocks should be synchronized on two end-point nodes of the link using PTP.

The delay measurement with probing is not supported on virtualized version of IOS XR. You will activate performance measurement on the lab node and advertise a static delay per interface.

## SR Policy liveness and delay measurement 

The PM for SR Policy uses the IP/UDP packet format defined in RFC 5357 (TWAMP-Light) for probes. Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) adds two-way or round-trip measurement capabilities. TWAMP employs time stamps applied at the echo destination (reflector) to enable greater accuracy. In the case of TWAMP Light, the Session-Reflector doesn’t necessarily know about the session state. The Session-Reflector simply copies the Sequence Number of the received packet to the Sequence Number field of the reflected packet. The controller receives the reflected test packets and collects two-way metrics. This architecture allows for collection of two-way metrics.

There is a need to monitor the end-to-end delay experienced by the traffic sent over an SR policy to ensure that the delay does not exceed the requested “upper-bound” and violate SLAs. You can verify the end-to-end delay values before activating the candidate-path or the segment lists of the SR policy in forwarding table, or to deactivate the active candidate-path or the segment lists of the SR policy in forwarding table.

:pushpin: 	
* The end-to-end delay value of an SR policy will be different from the path computation result (for example, the sum of TE link delay metrics) due to several factors, such as queuing delay within the routers.


### Liveness detection

> :warning: This feature is not supported on virtualized platform.

SR Policy liveness monitoring allows you to verify end-to-end traffic forwarding over an SR Policy candidate path by periodically sending performance monitoring (PM) packets. The head-end router sends PM packets to the SR policy's endpoint router, which sends them back to the head-end without any control-plane dependency on the endpoint router.

```

  policy to-xrd2-latency
   color 400 end-point ipv4 2.2.2.2
   candidate-paths
    performance-measurement
     liveness-detection
   !
  !
 !
!
```

The liveness monitoring allows operators to invalidate a candidate path if it doesn't match the probe SLA.

By default, if an SR Policy becomes invalid, traffic would fall back to the native SR forwarding path.

In some scenarios, a network operator may require that certain traffic be only carried over the path associated with an SR policy and never allow the native SR LSP to be used. The SR-TE Path Invalidation Drop feature is introduced to meet this requirement.

With the Path Invalidation Drop feature enabled, an SR policy that would become invalid (for example, no valid candidate path available) is programmed to drop traffic. At the same time, the SR policy stays up in the control plane to prevent prefixes mapped to the SR policy from falling back to the native SR LSP.

When the SR policy becomes valid again, forwarding over the SR policy resumes.

### Delay measurement

> :warning: This feature is not supported on virtualized platform.

Let you measure end-to-end delay of a given policy. 
It's important to note that end-to-end delay would be different from the sum of individual link of the policy path. The measurement end-to-end take into account the different routers packets processing.
