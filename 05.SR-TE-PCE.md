# Segment Routing Traffic engineering : Path Computation Element

In the following lab we will introduce a new concept and utilisation of a dynamic centralized control of a SR-TE network with the usage of a Path Computation Element (PCE). A Path Computation Element is an entity (component, application, or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
route based on a network graph and applying computational constraints.

For now the computation, and instantiation of the policy were done directly on the Path Computation Client (PCC) element. A Path Computation Client is any client application requesting a
path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element (PCE).

The communication between a PCE and a PCC is enabled via a Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) session.

By design, the PCE doesn't have to be part of the same AS of its different PCC. 
Border Gateway Protocol Link-State (BGP-LS) is an Address Family Identifier (AFI) and Sub-address Family Identifier (SAFI) defined to carry interior gateway protocol (IGP) link-state database through BGP routing protocol.
It's a common recommended design to maintain a BGP-LS session between the PCE and the autonomous system boundary router (ASBR) to exange different AS IGP topologies.

### Task 1. Configure the PCE

Connect to xrd-7
```bash
xrd 7
```

:keyboard: xrd-7
```bash
configure
pce
 address ipv4 7.7.7.7
!
commit 
end
```

### Task 2. Configure BGP-LS topology

:keyboard: xrd-7
```bash
!
router bgp 65000
 address-family link-state link-state
 !
 neighbor-group client
  address-family link-state link-state
  !
 !
commit
end
```

:keyboard: xrd-1 and xrd-2
```bash
configure
router bgp 65000
 address-family link-state link-state
 !
 neighbor-group RR-PCE
  address-family link-state link-state
  !
 !
commit
end
```

:keyboard: xrd-7
```bash
show pce ipv4 topology
```
```

### Task 3. Configure PCC with PCE 

:keyboard: xrd-1
```bash
config
segment-routing
 traffic-eng
  pcc
   source-address ipv4 1.1.1.1
   pce address ipv4 7.7.7.7
   !
   report-all
  !
 !
!
```

:note: The `report-all` keyword enable the `stateful` capability. The PCC will report all policy created to the PCE.

Verify peer association between PCC and PCE.

:keyboard: xrd-1
```bash
show segment-routing traffic-eng pcc ipv4 peer 
```
```
PCC's peer database:
--------------------

Peer address: 7.7.7.7, 
  Precedence: 255, (best PCE)
  State up
  Capabilities: Stateful, Update, Segment-Routing, Instantiation, SRv6
```

### Task 4. Instantiate a PCE-Delegated policy 

Several different policy instanciation are possible

| Concept                     | Description                                                           |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PCE initiated               | A policy created by a PCE                                             |
| PCC initiated               | A policy created by a PCC                                             |
| PCC initiated PCE delegated | A policy created by a PCC with a path computation delegation to a PCE |


Let's create a PCC initiated policy with a PCE delegated path.

:keyboard: xrd-1
```bash
config
segment-routing
 traffic-eng
  policy to-xrd2
   color 200 end-point ipv4 2.2.2.2
   candidate-paths
    preference 100
     dynamic
      pcep
      !
      metric
       type te
      !
     !
    !
   !
  !
 !
!
commit
end
```
