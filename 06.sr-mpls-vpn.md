# 06. SR-MPLS VPN

## SR-MPLS L3VPN

SR-MPLS (Segment Routing - Multiprotocol Label Switching) L3VPN (Layer 3 Virtual Private Network) is a type of virtual private network (VPN) that uses Segment Routing and MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) technology to route traffic between different sites or locations.

SR-MPLS L3VPNs allow multiple sites to be connected over a shared network infrastructure, allowing for the creation of a logical, private network that is isolated from the public internet. This can be used to securely connect branch offices, remote workers, and other sites, enabling them to communicate as if they were on the same local network.

SR-MPLS L3VPNs use MPLS labels to forward traffic between sites, and Segment Routing to calculate the optimal path through the network. This allows for advanced traffic engineering capabilities and the ability to optimize the performance of the VPN.

### Task 1. Verify BGP configuration

Visualize the BGP configuration. Router xrd-7 is configured to act as a route reflector server for the two PE : router xrd-1 and xrd-2

Connect to xrd-1
```bash
xrd 1
```

:keyboard: xrd-1
```bash
show run router bgp
```
```
router bgp 65000
 bgp router-id 1.1.1.1

 !
 address-family link-state link-state
 !
 neighbor-group RR-PCE
  remote-as 65000
  update-source Loopback0
  address-family vpnv4 unicast
  !
  address-family link-state link-state
  !
 !
 neighbor 7.7.7.7
  use neighbor-group RR-PCE
 !
!
```

:information_source: The configuration is similar on xrd-2

Verify BGP neighbor connection status.

:keyboard: xrd-1
```bash
show bgp neighbor brief
```
```

```

### Task 2. Create a VRF 

Create a VRF named `customer1` on xrd-1 and xrd-2:

:keyboard: xrd-1
```bash
config
vrf customer1
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  import route-target
   10:10
  !
  export route-target
   10:10
  !
 !
!

 vrf customer1
 ipv4 address 10.10.10.1/32
!
router bgp 65000
 vrf customer1
  rd 65000:1
  address-family ipv4 unicast
   redistribute connected
  !
 !
!
commit
end
exit
```

```bash
xrd 2
```

:keyboard: xrd-2
```bash
config
vrf customer1
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  import route-target
   10:10
  !
  export route-target
   10:10
  !
 !
!
interface loopback 10
 vrf customer1

 vrf customer1
  rd 65000:1

   redistribute connected
  !

commit
end
exit
```

### Task 3. Verify VPN state

Connect to xrd-1

```bash
xrd 1
```

:keyboard: xrd-1
```bash
show ip route vrf customer1 
```
```

B    10.10.10.2/32 [200/0] via 2.2.2.2 (nexthop in vrf default), 00:00:27
```

Notice that xrd-1 learned via `BGP`, xrd-2 loopback address `10.10.10.2/32` via `2.2.2.2`.

## SR-TE automatic steering 

SR (Segment Routing) prefix coloring is a technique used in traffic engineering to differentiate between different types of traffic or traffic classes in a network. It allows different policies or treatment to be applied to different traffic classes based on the color of the traffic.

In SR prefix coloring, a color is assigned to each prefix, or destination address, in the network. This color is then encoded in the packet header as the packet is forwarded through the network. Routers and other network devices can then use the color to apply different policies or treatment to the packet based on its color.

For example, a network might use SR prefix coloring to give higher priority to certain types of traffic, such as real-time video or voice traffic, by assigning a higher-priority color to those prefixes. This can help to ensure that the important traffic is given preferential treatment and is not delayed by other traffic.

### Task 4. Configure a SR-TE policy

The policy will have a PCE constraint. A policy with path disjointness constraint is a type of traffic engineering policy that requires the path of the policy's traffic to be distinct from certain other paths in the network, in order to improve resilience and reliability.

```

### Task 5. Configure the prefix coloring

A BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) extended community is a type of attribute that can be associated with a BGP route. It is used to carry additional information about the route, such as the route's origin, its intended use, or its intended destination.

BGP extended communities are defined as a pair of values, with each value being an unsigned 32-bit integer. The first value is called the "type" and the second value is called the "value". The type and value are combined to form a unique extended community attribute.

BGP extended communities can be used for a variety of purposes, such as controlling the route's behavior, influencing its selection, or providing additional information about the route.

![](images/8.svg)
Configure the prefix coloring. We want to advert routes learned in the VRF `customer1` with the color `300`.

:keyboard: xrd-2

```bash
config

 300
end-set
!

 set extcommunity color BEST_EFFORT_DIVERSITY
end
!
vrf customer1
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  export route-policy BEST_EFFORT_DIVERSITY
 !
!
commit
end
exit
```

Connect to xrd 1
```bash
xrd 1
```

:keyboard: xrd-1

```bash
config
